cChatServer
===========

This is the server application for my chat application [cChat] (github.com/cliffanderson/cChat) using Java. To run it, download the included jar file and run it with the latest update of Java 1.7 or newer. This uses simple Java Sockets and sends data as plain text. It operates over port 12345. The information on the command line is the message the user sent and their IP.
